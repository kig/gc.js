For fun.

No, really.

- mark_sweep.js: Version 0.0
                 Weird mark-and-sweep collector with a O(n^2) allocator.
                 Perhaps more accurately a mark-and-weep collector.
                 Instead of roots, uses pointers to self to mark
		 object as permanent. Don't do that.
		 Tags pointers with MSB set to 1.
		 Each allocation has {start, length}-struct as overhead.

		 Mark: go through array of allocs, go through body of each alloc,
		       marks found pointers.
		 Sweep: go through array of allocs, collect unmarked to free list,
		        delete each allocation in free list.
		 Compact: Uh? Free memory? Why?
